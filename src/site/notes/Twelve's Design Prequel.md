Hako lived at Brand's rental with Kwil and other researchers for a time. She and [[Kwil Farkos\|Kwil Farkos]] both studied human medicine and worked in the medical field. She was unaware of Kwil's affair with Kaliska, but she noticed him becoming increasingly unhappy over the course of their first year on Earth. Kwil and Kaliska's dates were always during the day so neither Brand nor Hako would think much of their absences.

Hako wonders if Kwil's depression is related to his urges. She recalls a Jigo's request the day she and Kwil left Earth that she contact him if Kwil needs help. She's long since ignored that request, but she wonders if she shouldn't have. Has Kwil been away from home and the [[Need Sanctuaries\|Need Sanctuaries]] too long? Does he miss Jigo? Despite her skepticism of Jigo's intentions, she can't deny he helped Kwil gain a sense of control and talk him out of dangerous mind manipulation games and group activities.

She asks Kwil if need to go home, fulfill his urges, and take break. He refuses. While he doesn't deny his urges are bad, he refuses to let them interfere with his work. Hako accepts this. She decides she isn't disturbed enough by Kwil's behavior to resort to calling on Jigo yet.

Hako was the surgeon that removed Kwil's kidney and transplanted it into Logan. She was aware Kwil was using mind manipulation on Logan during his operation to keep him calm and put him to sleep.

Kwil spent more time with Logan than anyone, feeling guilty for it being his project. During his times alone with Logan, he continued to use milder mind manipulation to try to reduce the trauma of the situation. He also began reading Logan's thoughts, already knowing that Logan would need to be observed for the rest of his life. Hako was unaware that Kwil was doing either of these things.

When it becomes clear Logan will survive, Kwil informs the others that he will need to be returned home and be observed. He won't be happy on their worlds. It does, however, present an opportunity to study whatever they have created and to see how he integrates into society. While Kwil sounds distant from what he describes to the GPO director [[Draska Bakein\|Draska Bakein]], Hako knows his devastation as well as she knows her own. Draska knows it is a disaster as well as anyone who was involved in Kwil's project.

Kwil volunteers himself to watch Logan, and he recommends they treat it as exile for his crimes. Hako volunteers to join him, but Draska points out that's hardly an exile to send married partners to the same planet. Kwil agrees but because he doesn't want Hako there. He doesn't admit it aloud, but he believes he should be punished alone. He is a deviant. He has dreamed that something evil within him caused this nightmare, and he's told no one of his daughter. Draska, knowing his connections to Jigo and biased against his deviance, is eager to see him punished and blamed for the GPO's failures.

Hako demands mediation from the pajar. They re-explain their predicament to the pajar in a closed court session: no observers. Closed court session are determined by the fanva in only the rarest circumstances. In this case, the fanva saw the possibility of mass panic should any observers leak what was happening within the GPO to the public. And observers loyal to the gods had every right to do so.

Disturbed by the GPO's story, the pajar agrees Logan must be returned home. He has suffered enough. The damage their intrusion into human society caused has already been done. All they can do is observe the aftermath. Punishment must also be dealt to demonstrate to the gods that they will atone for their crimes and take responsibility for the consequences. They need to convince the gods not to do worse.

Kwil is exiled to Earth for the remainder of Logan's life and Kadas afterward. After the GPO reveals what they have done to the public, everyone who participated in the experiment will also be exiled to Kadas. That should not happen immediately though. The pajar hopes Kwil's time on Earth will give him time to find a silver lining, something to prevent mass panic. Until then, no one in the room is to speak of what has happened. The other members of the project are to go about their lives, give the impression that the state of the GPO hasn't changed.

Draska is outraged that she will also be punished for Kwil's actions. Kwil is a deviant, susceptible to illogical manipulation from his sexual partners, and Jigo Kadas, the war monger, is one of them. The pajar dismisses her complaints as irrelevant and inappropriate. Draska consoles herself that she will find a way to prove all of this is Jigo's doing. His influence on Kwil was done with intent to start a war. The pajar's delay in her punishment has given her time to figure out how to avoid it all together.

Hako protests that she should be the one condemned to Earth. She performed the surgery. She condoned Kwil's use of mind manipulation. She is a doctor sworn to do no harm, and she agreed to perform an unnecessary surgery. The pajar entertains her suggestion. Kwil, who has portrayed nothing but calm acceptance of his punishment, however descends into a fit of hysteria. He doesn't want Hako to witness what he's done, to watch what's left of Logan, to bear the burden of his guilt and sin.

"Kwil, you are making me think this punishment is far more fitting for you," the pajar says darkly.

Hako has the opposite reaction. "Pajar, I rescind my suggestion. We've caused enough suffering. The gods would not smile upon torture." She knows Kwil's history of depression and doesn't want him to become suicidal. It's better he have something to do, some sliver of hope, even if it means he will take more responsibility than he should.

The pajar agrees to their original arrangement. Hako and Kwil have until the end of the court session to say their goodbyes. Kwil's exile will begin immediately within the GPO Headquarters until Logan is ready to return to Earth. He and Hako are to never see each other again.

Meanwhile, Jigo Kadas notices the change in activity within and around the GPO Headquarters during the year of Logan's recovery. The GPO's contributions to the public libraries, usually dozens of documents, videos, and audio clips per day, trickles to a handful per day. In observing GPO Headquarters, he notices Hako and the other researchers he thought were on Earth coming and going from the building. GPO members have looked miserable about their jobs for years, but these ones look pale faced with shock, horror, or terror. Kwil, when Jigo finally catches a glimpse of him, is in a worse state that anyone. Hako can't even coax him to leave the building it seems. The possibility of Jigo confronting him is the reason. He knows Jigo is out there.

Jigo often pesters the GPO members coming and going from the building. No one talks to him and everyone treats him as a nuisance. The researchers are no exception, not even Hako. Not that Hako has ever particularly liked Jigo, but she has been willing to speak with him about Kwil.

"How is Kwil?"

That's all Jigo really wants to know, and she won't even tell him that.

Kwil hasn't returned to Earth in all the twenty years he's been there. He hasn't spoken to Jigo telepathically either. That has never sat well with Jigo considering how much support Kwil needed to maintain his control and tenuous acceptance of his urges even up until the night before he left for Earth. It took Jigo years to convince Kwil to entertain the possibility of there being a difference between bisexuality and sex addiction. Bisexuality is part of Kwil's identity. Sex addiction was inflicted on him by years of mind manipulation and abuse. The closest person Kwil had to a therapist, Jigo was still trying to untangle that mess when Kwil went to Earth and stopped speaking to him.

Jigo's pestering and stalking of Hako, Draska, and other members of the research team earns him a temporary exile to Kadas when Draska requests a closed court session. She claims while explaining the circumstances to the fanva that Jigo even knowing the GPO requested a private session will make him suspicious. The GPO is supposed to operate in public as their work affects everyone. Jigo will likely make a scene. The pajar grants her request on multiple stalking charges, although Jigo's behavior has not been extreme enough to be a punishable offense.

By the time Jigo returns to the GPO's Headquarters on Ji a quarter year later, Kwil has already returned to Earth. Hako, knowing Jigo will continue pestering her, moves to Marti where her family lives, and makes arrangements with Draska to continue her research there. Draska suggests they request Jigo's permanent exile, but Hako doesn't want him punished for her crimes either. Jigo observes from the number of employees entering and exiting the building daily and from the uploads to the public archives that the GPOs activities have slowed significantly. He doesn't see Hako, Kwil, or any of the other employees that were on Earth. Not wanting to earn another exile Draska threatens him with, he tries a different approach than pestering employees to get more information.

Jigo volunteers at the pajar court. As has happened on several occasions in the past when he needs information he can't otherwise obtain and about the GPO and specifically Kwil, he earns the fanva's notice and sympathy.

"Your philanthropy is appreciated, but I sense you need something," the fanva says when he notices Jigo staying late one day, after the last court session of the day has ended.

"What's happened to the GPO?" Jigo asks.

"Nothing as far as I know. I don't work there."

"They don't upload as much content."

"If you're complaining about lack of content when the GPO has collected and published hundreds of thousands of hours worth of human literature, films, and audio clips over the past twenty years, perhaps you need a new hobby."

"Then, just tell me what happened to Kwil and Hako. That's all I want."

Jigo continues that he saw them at GPO Headquarters, but they refused to speak with him or avoided him. He's worried about Kwil. The fanva knows Jigo's worry for Kwil well. Much of it was unfounded from his perspective, but knowing the trouble the GPO is in now, the fanva knows he has a right to worry now. He decides to give Jigo a chance to help. If the gods are angry with them already, they don't have much other choice.

"Kwil returned to Earth two months ago," the fanva admits. "Hako didn't go with him."

"That can't be." Jigo can't believe Hako would ever let Kwil return to Earth alone. That confirms something is terribly wrong.

The fanva doesn't know Hako's whereabouts, so Jigo sets out to find her. He digs up old news articles about the first GPO researchers destined for long-term residence on Earth. Hako and Kwil were among them. Some articles mention that Hako is from Marti. With no better leads and nothing he'd rather do with the time the gods have given him, Jigo spends the next two years traveling from village to village on Marti in search of Hako and periodically monitoring GPO Headquarters on Ji. He makes himself a nuisance in hopes of pressuring Hako's family, friends, or Hako herself to step forward.

Jigo's presence on Marti becomes well known. The pajar receives occasional complaints from residents that Jigo Kadas is "loitering" in their village and requests to have him temporarily or permanently banned from Marti. These calls to action go unanswered. Jigo Kadas, the war monger, has been pestering the GPO and its members for decades. The only difference now is that the pajar and the fanva know that his concern in well founded.

Hako stays hidden initially. Two years into Kwil's exile, however, his mental health--paranoia, anxiety, depression, and feelings of being sinful and tainted--has deteriorated to the point where Hako is desperate enough to ask Jigo for help. She follows the latest rumors of the zarkis' whereabouts and uses the nearest kasta center to go to him.

"Two years!?" Jigo exclaims upon seeing her.

"Two years," Hako repeats. "You don't know when to quit, do you? You never have."
