Knowing Jigo Kadas will continue pestering her at the end of his ban from Ji, Hako moves to Marti where her family lives. She makes arrangements with Draska to continue working as an archivist for the [[Concepts/The Great Peace Organization\|GPO]] from there. Primarily, she digitizes, redacts, edits, and organizes Kwil's continued written and verbal reports for public consumption or for private storage in the GPO's vault. Draska suggests they request Jigo be [[Concepts/Exiles\|permanently banned]] from Ji instead. Hako's more sensitive work would be better kept within GPO's Headquarters. Hako doesn't want Jigo punished for her crimes though. Kwil would not want that either.

Two years into Kwil's exile, his deteriorating mental health--paranoia, anxiety, depression, and feelings of being sinful and tainted--pushed Hako to desperation. She decides to ask Jigo for help. She follows the latest rumors of the zarkis' whereabouts and uses the nearest kasta center to go to him.

"Two years!?" Jigo exclaims upon seeing her.

"Two years," Hako repeats. "You don't know when to quit. You never have."

For the sake of everyone on the planet he's annoyed, Hako invites him to her home should he ever need to find her again. There, she explains vaguely that something terrible has happened within the GPO. Kwil is the last remaining researcher on Earth. Everyone else has lost faith. Jigo asks why Hako isn't with him. Minimizing how much she tells Jigo, Hako avoids saying that Kwil is exiled. She gives the excuse that Draska wanted him to suffer alone for his mistakes, which is true. 

If Jigo wants to know more, she wants him to convince Kwil to talk. She suspects he's hiding things, things happening now, things that have happened over the past 20 years, and things he won't even admit to her. She knows Kwil used to tell Jigo things he didn't know how to explain or tell her. Jigo understood him better than she ever could. She needs him to help Kwil again, convince him to talk about everything that's driving him insane.

Jigo asks why no one forces him to come home. Hako gives another true excuse: he believes he's the last hope for their species to survive the gods' wrath. Draska won't let him come home either.

Jigo accepts Hako's vague explanations and excuses. He wants to help but points out that he lost his telepathic connection to Kwil almost two decades ago. Kwil hasn't spoken to him since he left for Earth. The GPO would never let Jigo set foot on Earth either.

"I think I know how to get you there," Hako says. If she's become desperate enough to ask Jigo for help, Draska may be desperate enough for a solution to let Jigo try to find one, too. If Draska is still resistant, Hako will involve the pajar. The pajar will listen to reason, and they all know the gods kept Jigo alive for a reason. Why shouldn't they think it is to resolve the GPO's problems?

She and Jigo will need to approach Kwil with more tact to take down his defenses and coax him to talk. Sending Jigo to Earth with the explicit purpose to investigate the GPO and interrogate Kwil will surely do the opposite. Hako proposes Jigo pursue his interest in the porjorde, the spiritual knowledgebase the gods warned them of. Among the literature Kwil has sent from Earth is information about a human by the name Seth Rose who may have direct access to the porjorde. She proposes Jigo seek him out as a ruse to discover his purpose.

Jigo says he is already aware of Seth Rose. He reviews everything the GPO publishes regarding humanity's theories on the supernatural in his pursuit of the porjorde. Seeking Seth won't be a ruse. He doubts Kwil will buy from either of them that Jigo hasn't come to investigate the GPO or coax Kwil to talk, but Seth Rose will his give a good excuse to seek his unfinished business elsewhere until Kwil and the GPO become unignorable.

Hako doesn't tell Jigo she has a different reason for suggesting he pursue Seth Rose. She suspects Seth will give Jigo everything he needs to pressure Kwil or pursue his investigation on his own should Kwil continue to resist.

Before departing Hako's home, Jigo offers her a baltarik handshake. "Maintain a connection with me this time?" Jigo complains. It's a reminder of the days leading up to Kwil and Hako's departure to Earth. Jigo asked Hako to make a connection with him then just in case Kwil needed help and wouldn't admit it. Hako listened, but like Kwil, let their connection wither and disappear. She would have preferred to never resort to asking the zarkis for help, but she has to admit that might have been a mistake. Hako agrees to his request this time.
