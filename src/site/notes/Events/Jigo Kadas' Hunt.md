Jigo Kadas notices the change in activity within and around the GPO Headquarters during the year of Logan's recovery. The GPO's contributions to the public libraries, usually dozens of documents, videos, and audio clips per day, trickles to a handful per day. In observing GPO Headquarters, he notices Hako and the other researchers he thought were on Earth coming and going from the building. GPO members have looked miserable about their jobs for years, but these ones look pale faced with shock, horror, or terror. Kwil, when Jigo finally catches a glimpse of him, is in a worse state that anyone. Hako can't even coax him to leave the building it seems. The possibility of Jigo confronting him is the reason. He knows Jigo is out there.

Jigo often pesters the GPO members coming and going from the building. No one talks to him and everyone treats him as a nuisance. The researchers are no exception, not even Hako. Not that Hako has ever particularly liked Jigo, but she has been willing to speak with him about Kwil. "How is Kwil?" That's all Jigo really wants to know, and she won't even tell him that.

Kwil hasn't returned to Earth in all the twenty years he's been there. He hasn't spoken to Jigo telepathically either. That has never sat well with Jigo considering how much support Kwil needed to maintain his control and tenuous acceptance of his urges even up until the night before he left for Earth. It took Jigo years to convince Kwil to entertain the possibility of there being a difference between bisexuality and sex addiction. Bisexuality is part of Kwil's identity. Sex addiction was inflicted on him by years of mind manipulation and abuse. The closest person Kwil had to a therapist, Jigo was still trying to untangle that mess when Kwil went to Earth and stopped speaking to him.

Jigo's pestering and stalking of Hako, Draska, and other members of the research team earns him a temporary ban from Ji when Draska requests a closed court session. She claims while explaining the circumstances to the fanva that Jigo even knowing the GPO requested a private session will make him suspicious. The GPO is supposed to operate in public as their work affects everyone. Jigo will likely make a scene. The pajar grants her request on multiple stalking charges, although Jigo's behavior has not been extreme enough to be a punishable offense.

Jigo bides his time from his home on Kadas by monitoring the the GPO's uploads. By the time he's allowed to return to Ji a quarter year later, Kwil has already returned to Earth. Jigo observes from the number of employees entering and exiting the building daily and from the uploads to the public archives that the GPOs activities have slowed significantly. He doesn't see Hako, Kwil, or any of the other employees that were on Earth. When Draska threatening him with another ban from Ji, he tries a different approach than pestering employees to get more information.

Jigo volunteers at the pajar court. As has happened on several occasions in the past when he needs information he can't otherwise obtain and about the GPO and specifically Kwil, he earns the fanva's notice and sympathy.

"Your philanthropy is appreciated, but I sense you need something," the fanva says when he notices Jigo staying late one day, after the last court session of the day has ended.

"What's happened to the GPO?" Jigo asks.

"Nothing as far as I know. I don't work there."

"They don't upload as much content."

"If you're complaining about lack of content when the GPO has collected and published hundreds of thousands of hours worth of human literature, films, and audio clips over the past twenty years, perhaps you need a new hobby."

"Then, just tell me what happened to Kwil and Hako. That's all I want."

Jigo continues that he saw them at GPO Headquarters, but they refused to speak with him or avoided him. He's worried about Kwil. The fanva knows Jigo's worry for Kwil well. Much of it was unfounded from his perspective, but knowing the trouble the GPO is in now, the fanva knows he has a right to worry now. He decides to give Jigo a chance to help. If the gods are angry with them already, they don't have much other choice.

"Kwil returned to Earth two months ago," the fanva admits. "Hako didn't go with him."

"That can't be." Jigo can't believe Hako would ever let Kwil return to Earth alone. That confirms something is terribly wrong.

The fanva doesn't know Hako's whereabouts, so Jigo sets out to find her. He digs up old news articles about the first GPO researchers destined for long-term residence on Earth. Hako and Kwil were among them. Some articles mention that Hako is from Marti. With no better leads and nothing he'd rather do with the time the gods have given him, Jigo spends the next two years traveling from village to village on Marti in search of Hako and periodically monitoring GPO Headquarters on Ji. He makes himself a nuisance in hopes of pressuring Hako's family, friends, or Hako herself to step forward.

Jigo's presence on Marti becomes well known. The pajar receives occasional complaints from residents that Jigo Kadas is "loitering" in their village and requests to have him temporarily or permanently banned from Marti. These calls to action go unanswered. Jigo Kadas, the war monger, has been pestering the GPO and its members for decades. The only difference now is that the pajar and the fanva know his concern in well founded.
