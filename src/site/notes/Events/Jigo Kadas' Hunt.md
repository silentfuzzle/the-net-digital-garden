Jigo Kadas noticed the change in activity within and around the GPO Headquarters during the year of Logan's abduction and recovery. The GPO's contributions to the public libraries, usually dozens of documents, videos, and audio clips per day, trickled to a handful per day. In observing GPO Headquarters, he noticed not only a sharp decrease in activity but also Hako and the other researchers he thought were on Earth coming and going from the building. GPO members had looked miserable about their jobs for years, but these ones were pale-faced. Kwil, when Jigo finally caught a glimpse of him, looked the worst. Hako couldn't even coax him to leave the building. Little did Jigo know Kwil feared encountering him as much as he feared what was inside the building.

Jigo often pestered GPO Headquarters employees and was consequently ignored and treated as a nuisance. These researchers were no exception.

"How is Kwil?"

That was all Jigo really wanted to know. Not that Hako had ever particularly liked him, but Kwil was the one commonality and connection between them. Now she wouldn't even talk to him about that.

Kwil's complete absence and silence over his past twenty years on Earth had never sat well with Jigo, considering how much support Kwil needed even up until the nigempht before he left. It took Jigo years to convince Kwil to entertain the that there was a difference between bisexuality and sex addiction. Bisexuality was part of Kwil's identity. Sex addiction was inflicted on him by decades of mind manipulation and abuse. The closest person Kwil had to a mind doctor, Jigo was still trying to untangle that mess when Kwil went to Earth and stopped speaking to him.

Jigo's pestering and stalking of Hako, Draska, and other members of the research team earned him a [[Concepts/Exiles\|temporary ban]] from Ji shortly before the GPO's closed court hearing. The fanvas agreed with Draska's assessment that Jigo even knowing the Pajasul Court hosted a closed session with the GPO, an organization that was supposed to operate in public view, would make him suspicious and cause a scene. In a public trial requested by Draska, the pajas, advised by the fanvas, banned Jigo from Ji on multiple stalking charges, although Jigo's behavior has not been extreme enough to warrant such a punishment.

Jigo bided his time from his home on Kadas by monitoring the the GPO's uploads. By the time he was allowed to return to Ji a quarter year later, Kwil had already returned to Earth. The sparse activities around GPO Headquarters hadn't changed, and Jigo saw no sign of the researchers from Earth. When Draska threatened his renewed pestering with another ban from Ji, he tried a different approach to get more information.

Jigo volunteered at the pajas court. As has happened on several occasions in the past when he needs information he can't otherwise obtain and about the GPO and specifically Kwil, he earns the fanvas' notice and sympathy.

"Your philanthropy is appreciated, but I sense you need something," the fanvas says when he notices Jigo staying late one day, after the last court session of the day has ended.

"What's happened to the GPO?" Jigo asks.

"Nothing as far as I know. I don't work there."

"They don't upload as much content."

"If you're complaining about lack of content when the GPO has collected and published hundreds of thousands of hours worth of human literature, films, and audio clips over the past twenty years, perhaps you need a new hobby."

"Then, just tell me what happened to Kwil and Hako. That's all I want."

Jigo continues that he saw them at GPO Headquarters, but they refused to speak with him or avoided him. He's worried about Kwil. The fanvas knows Jigo's worry for Kwil well. Much of it was unfounded from his perspective, but knowing the trouble the GPO is in now, the fanvas knows he has a right to worry. He decides to give Jigo a chance to help. If the gods are angry with them already, they don't have much other choice.

"Kwil returned to Earth two months ago," the fanvas admits. "Hako didn't go with him."

"That can't be." Jigo can't believe Hako would ever let Kwil return to Earth alone. That confirms something is terribly wrong.

The fanvas doesn't know Hako's whereabouts, so Jigo sets out to find her. He digs up old news articles about the first GPO researchers destined for long-term residence on Earth. Hako and Kwil were among them. Some articles mention that Hako is from Marti. With no better leads and nothing he'd rather do with the time the gods have given him, Jigo spends the next two years traveling from village to village on Marti in search of Hako and periodically monitoring GPO Headquarters on Ji. He makes himself a nuisance in hopes of pressuring Hako's family, friends, or Hako herself to step forward.

Jigo's presence on Marti becomes well known. The pajas receives occasional complaints from residents that Jigo Kadas is "loitering" in their village and requests to have him temporarily or permanently banned from Marti. These calls to action go unanswered. Jigo Kadas, the war monger, has been pestering the GPO and its members for decades. The only difference now is that the pajas and the fanvas know his concern was well founded.
