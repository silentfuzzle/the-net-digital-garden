Hako Pital and Draska Bakein approached the court with a request for mediation in regard to resolving a complication in the [[Events/A Request to Exile Kwil Farkos\|A Request to Exile Kwil Farkos]]. Hako stated that Kwil's mental health had deteriorated to the point where she doubted he would be able to continue his appeal to the gods, his work for the GPO, or his attempt to justify his actions to the public. With his mission to the gods incomplete, Hako requested that Jigo be sent to Earth to help him. Draska Bakein disagreed, arguing that Kwil's deterioration was merely a product of his just punishment. His exile should continue as sentenced.

The pajas questioned why anyone should be sent to Earth and why Kwil should remain there. The gods have always been patient and merciful. Even Kwil's failure may be no exception or reason for further concern. Why shouldn't Kwil merely be recalled, his exile continued on Kadas, and the mission abandoned as a failure? They all already knew such an outcome was a possibility.

Hako argued the gods also taught them to be resilient and not to assume their favor. As long as they had avenues, they should try to atone for their mistakes.

Draska agreed Kwil's sins were unforgivable. His punishment should not be lessened until he can prove otherwise. Unbeknownst to the court, she refused to accept punishment for Kwil's mistakes to begin upon his return and hoped for him to unwittingly incriminate himself as a lone saboteur. 

Hako continued Jigo Kadas' return from Jadul Mara was evidence the gods were displeased. They all knew Jigo should have been part of the GPO from the beginning, and the gods had given them another chance to accept that, one they had yet to take.

Draska contended the gods rejected him from Jadul Mara. He was the last descendant of the Kadas bloodline, the zarkis, the warmonger. He had not done enough to show he was any different than his ancestors. His water remained too tainted to even be recycled. 

The pajas questioned why such a controversial and high profile figure was even most appropriate to help Kwil. Why not send another GPO member already aware of the experiment to help? Including an outsider in such a sensitive matter, especially someone as outspoken as Jigo Kadas, might instigate the mass panic they had been avoiding.

Hako argued a volunteer from within the GPO wouldn't do. Kwil had secrets beyond the Logan Cusick experiment. Convincing him to admit them may be crucial to their survival and avoiding the gods' wrath. She and Jigo were the only people Kwil trusted, and he trusted Jigo even more than her. Perhaps he would trust him even with the secrets he was keeping now.

The pajas asked why Jigo had not convinced Kwil to talk already. If they were friends, surely they spoke.

Hako admitted Jigo no longer had a telepathic connection to Kwil. Kwil had not spoken to him in twenty years, since he arrived on Earth, for reasons she didn't know. She suspected he felt he was a disappointment after all the support, both public and private, Jigo had given him. This was why she believed he had secrets beyond the experiment.

Draska argued if it was even true that they no longer spoke, it was evidence that Kwil was trying to escape the zarkis' influence. Hako believed what she did of their relationship only based on what Kwil told her and what Jigo showed her. Their relationship may be more manipulative than she knew, and it may have never even ended.

Hako admitted she suspected Jigo's motives, too, but in the past fifty years, he had given her no reason to believe he had ulterior motives. He had been nothing but a positive influence on Kwil's life.

The fanvas supported that Jigo's concern for Kwil over the years seemed genuine. Additionally, he didn't have an army. Why would he start a war he couldn't fight?

"To justify his desire for an army," Draska argued.

The pajas admitted her biases against Jigo aligned with Draska's but conceded Draska's arguments relied on conjecture. There was more evidence to support that Jigo's friendship with Kwil was genuine. In sending him to Earth, she saw little reason to think he would use the opportunity for any other purpose than to help an estranged friend and fulfill the purpose the gods require of him. Even if his blood was tainted enough for the gods to reject him from Jadul Mara, that didn't mean he didn't seek their acceptance.

Outraged, Draska argued Jigo was a deviant who used his relationship with Kwil to manipulate him for his own ends. If he went to Earth, he would complete his plans. A deviant like Kwil should have never been allowed to go to Earth either.

"It may be popular to treat deviants as a protected minority, but they were forsaken by the gods for a reason," Draska said.

"Not that it's any of your business, but their relationship was platonic," Hako argued.

"Yet another story Kwil told you, no doubt."

The pajas dismissed the entire outburst as irrelevant and inappropriate. Refocusing the court session, she pointed out that sending Jigo Kadas to Earth would not go unnoticed. The GPO must be prepared to explain themselves to the public.
