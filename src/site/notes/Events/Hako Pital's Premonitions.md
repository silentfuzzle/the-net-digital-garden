Hako lived at Brand's rental with Kwil and the other researchers that came and went. She and [[Figures/Kwil Farkos\|Kwil Farkos]] both studied human medicine and worked in the medical field. She was unaware of Kwil's affair with Kaliska, but she noticed him becoming increasingly unhappy over the course of their first year on Earth. Kwil and Kaliska's dates were always during the day so neither Brand nor Hako would think much of their absences.

Hako wonders if Kwil's depression is related to his urges. She recalls a Jigo's request the day she and Kwil left Earth that she contact him if Kwil needs help. She's long since ignored that request, but she wonders if she shouldn't have. Has Kwil been away from home and the [[Concepts/Need Sanctuaries\|Need Sanctuaries]] too long? Does he miss Jigo? Despite her skepticism of Jigo's intentions, she can't deny he helped Kwil gain a sense of control and talk him out of the Sanctuaries' dangerous activities.

She asks Kwil if he needs to go home, fulfill his urges, and take a break. He refuses. While he doesn't deny his urges are bad, he won't let them interfere with his work. Hako decides she isn't disturbed enough by Kwil's behavior to resort to calling on Jigo yet. The dark mood Thomas carries for their remaining years together on Earth can be explained by the anxiousness they all carry. They still haven't found a way to fulfill the gods' will. What happens if they never find it?
