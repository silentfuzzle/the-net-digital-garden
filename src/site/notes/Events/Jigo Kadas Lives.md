Seven years into the expedition to Earth, Draska calls a meeting of the researchers on Earth. She informs them that Jigo Kadas lives. He has returned as a pruktau. He says the gods returned him from nilmara to fulfill a holy mission. He claims this proves the GPO's need for him.

She adds dismissively that Jigo Kadas has been claiming such nonsense for years. He nitpicks at the GPO's perceived flaws and warns them of dangers as if he's spent any time on Earth unlike the rest of them. He pesters them to accept him as an advisor as if he knows better. He doesn't.

She proposes it's more likely the gods rejected him for his bloodlust. The GPO's operations will not change in light of this news. Jigo Kadas will not join their ranks. The gods will have to appear at the Pajasul Court and state their will themselves for her to believe that Jigo Kadas was chosen by them.

The researchers are shaken by the news. While they've dismissed the warmonger's warnings and offerings over the years, his persistence has still sowed doubt. Their lack of progress seven years into their expedition has also begun to wear on them. Draska's confidence and explanation, however, keeps most of them content. Hako and Kwil are the exceptions. Kwil is outraged and terrified by the news, and Hako senses it.

"He should have advised us from the beginning," Kwil tells her privately later. "We should have listened to him. All this time, he should have been one of us."

Hako argues that he can join them now. They can fight for him. If Draska continues to disagree, they can elevate the dispute to the pajas. Hako admits she's always been skeptical of Jigo's motives, but she can't deny he's shown nothing but kindness to Kwil or given her reason to think he'll betray the GPO's mission. She wants to give him a chance.

"It's too late," Kwil says. "Why should the gods forgive us when we rejected their will for 37 years and still we ignore it?"

Hako continues trying to convince him, but she doesn't know the source of his hopelessness isn't the GPO's pride or lack of progress. Kwil has always believed Jigo belonged on Earth. He has no doubt the gods returned Jigo from nilmara to fulfill his purpose there, and that proves how wrong the GPO was to reject him and how wrong Kwil was to not defend him. Perhaps if Jigo had been an advisor to the GPO from the beginning, Esarose wouldn't exist, but now Kwil can't bear the thought that the gods have condemned Jigo to bear the weight of his sins. He determines to use the knowledge he's gained for some good before Jigo discovers what he's done. He's seeking atonement that's impossible to attain, but he can't condemn Jigo to that fate. He has to try.

While Hako fights for Jigo's position in the GPO, Kwil dedicates himself to his research. Kwil allows himself to delve deeper into the similarities between humans and baltariks, a subject that once brought too many thoughts of Esarose for him to pursue. He can't afford to avoid it any longer. He proposes the feasibility of transplanting baltarik organs and body parts into humans for the first time. The breakthrough in his research gives Draska enough fuel to fend off Hako's defense of Jigo in the Pajasul Court. The pajas and the public is convinced enough by Kwil's progress to not resort to the risk of sending Jigo Kadas to Earth.

Hako confronts Kwil about his refusal to defend Jigo. Kwil is forced to admit that he fears he's done something unforgiveable, and he doesn't want the gods to have condemned Jigo to resolve it because of him. He has to try to fix it himself. Suddenly afraid of what he's done, Hako doesn't press him. She agrees to allow him to continue as long as he promises to tell her when it becomes unbearable to carry alone. He agrees.

Jigo remains an outsider to the GPO for the next 13 years.
