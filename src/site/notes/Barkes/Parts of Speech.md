## Nouns
**Singular**
Words beginning with a consonant and ending with a vowel.

**Proper**
Singular nouns ending in a consonant refer to a specific instance of the concept the noun represents. For example, pital, pitak, pitab, pitav, pitac, etc. can all be used to refer to a specific instance of a person or thing representing pita (flower). Names for baltariks, pets, landmarks, etc. frequently use this convention.

Singular nouns ending in l are the generic proper form of the noun. For example, pita means "the concept of a flower" and pital means "a flower-like person or thing."

**Plural**
Singular nouns ending with an n.
