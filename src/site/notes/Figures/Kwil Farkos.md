Kwil Farkos was among the GPO's first members and was one of the first baltariks sent to Earth for long-term residence and study. He was an expert in human and baltarik anatomy. Much of his research focused on kantisk's potential use in human medicine.

Kwil was born and raised on Marti. He has since become estranged or disowned by his family for his bisexuality. This was true even before he was publicly outted by GPO Director [[Figures/Draska Bakein\|Draska Bakein]] shortly after he joined the GPO. Through a public trial and vote, he was accepted and allowed to continue as a GPO member with the help of Jigo Kadas, who wrote the anonymous article on Kwil's life that prompted Draska's investigation.
