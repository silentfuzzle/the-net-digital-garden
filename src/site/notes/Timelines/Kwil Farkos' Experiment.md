Jigo met Kwil shortly after the Great Peace Organization was founded. Initially, he was intrigued to find a GPO member at a [[Concepts/Need Sanctuaries\|Need Sanctuary]] and saw a potential opportunity to obtain insider information. He soon realized that Kwil, like many who frequented the sanctuaries, was deeply troubled. Jigo's interest in him shifted toward helping him.

He learned Kwil was attracted to one of his asexual coworkers, Hako Pital. She also liked him, but he was reluctant to pursue a relationship because he was ashamed of what he was and didn't feel in control of himself. Jigo encouraged him to talk through his feelings and develop healthier habits to treat his sex addiction and negative mindset. Eventually, Kwil felt well enough to admit his feelings to Hako and marry her.

His struggles continued though. Three years into his marriage, Kwil used mind manipulation on Hako in an attempt to demonstrate his feelings for her. After this, Hako insisted that he use the Need Sanctuaries until they were ready to have children, once their duties to the GPO were fulfilled. Jigo was able to convince Kwil to continue his relationship with her, an outcome she wanted as well, but Kwil never forgave himself. It was confirmation that he was unfixable, and his wife's loss of trust in him was well deserved. His desire for her only increasing with her refusal to abide added to his disgust and frustration with himself.

In an attempt to revive Kwil's confidence, Jigo included his story in an anonymous collection of anecdotes and arguments supporting allosexual rights a year later. While Jigo had published several such collections in the past, the public found this latest installment particularly compelling and controversial not only for Kwil's story but for its arguments including comparisons to human sexuality, spirituality, and morality.

The GPO director Draska Bakein was among the many who didn't share these radical sentiments toward allosexuals. Instead, Draska determined to hunt down the allosexual in the GPO. When she caught Kwil at a Need Sanctuary, she promptly outed him publicly and dismissed him from the GPO. While Kwil was initially unwilling to defend himself, he eventually joined Jigo and Hako in arguing his GPO membership before the pajas. Draska was forced to reinstate his position when both the pajas' judgment and a tight public vote held at her own request fell in Kwil's favor.

Baltariks with specialties in law, economics, education, security, and related fields laid the groundwork for long-term researchers to live on Earth. The gods gave them only one connection to Earth, which required them to work around the United States government but also limited the options and research required. Over years and decades, these baltariks forged identities, constructed believable backgrounds, and researched housing and living arrangements.

In the spring of 1992, baltarik researchers began living part- or full-time on Earth in order to apply to the local university in the vicinity of their connection to their home worlds, purchase housing, and establish their identities as incoming college students. Kwil and Hako were among the last to join their fellow long-term researchers in the fall, shortly before the start of the school year.

Traveling to Earth to serve the gods and fulfill their mission was Kwil's dream, but he worried about his ability to leave the sanctuaries. He didn't express it, but he feared his desires would transfer to humans. Of what Jigo knew of Kwil's fears, he reassured him he could return home as he needed, and he would always be listening if Kwil needed to talk. Still, sensing Kwil wasn't telling him everything, Jigo asked Hako to establish and maintain a telepathic connection with him to contact him should Kwil need help and be unwilling to express it.

Despite knowing Jigo's importance in Kwil's life and her relationship with him, Hako's' skepticism of Jigo's intentions had remained. She still suspected he was using Kwil in a long-running plot to infiltrate the GPO. She established a connection with Jigo to satisfy him but didn't intend to use it, let alone maintain it.

The day Kwil and Hako left for Earth, Kwil met his human landlady, Kaliska Danil. In appearance, she had many similarities to Hako, he noticed. Too many. If the opportunity ever arose, he knew he couldn't and wouldn't resist the temptation to feed his urges with her. Terrifyingly and excitingly, she showed interest in him, too.

Jigo contacted him that night and frequently thereafter to ask how he was. Ashamed and unreceptive to his help, Kwil didn't answer him. Once his affair with Kaliska began, he determined never to speak to Jigo again if he could help it. He was broken, and he didn't want to perpetuate the false impression that Jigo could do anything to fix that.

Kwil's affair with Kaliska continued despite his increasing anger and disgust with himself. He found Kaliska's allure it too great to overcome. In her presence, he felt normal and acceptable for the first time, even after he inevitably had to reveal his true identity. He even felt happy and content, but by how terrible he felt outside of their encounters, he knew it was an illusion. He was further from his dream of serving the gods and more sinful than he'd ever been. He attempted to convince Kaliska to end their affair, but she didn't believe he really wanted that. He didn't either.
</details>

<details><summary>Twelve's Design spoilers</summary>
Their encounters continued even after Kaliska discovered she was pregnant in December 1992. Both she and Kwil dismissed it as a few nights she'd shared with her husband, Brand. When an ultrasound in March 1993 revealed a problem with the baby's ears and skull, however, Kwil knew he was the father. Kwil refused Kaliska's attempts to convince him to run away with her. He attempted to convince Kaliska to give Esarose to him, but he didn't resist when Kaliska gave her up for adoption instead. He felt cursed, tainted, and unworthy of caring for her. Kaliska continued attempting to convince him to renew their relationship and save her from her deteriorating personal life until she was killed in a car accident in 2006. Kwil blamed himself for everything, for thinking his sins wouldn't have an effect beyond destroying himself.

Meanwhile, Hako and Kwil became the longest-standing researchers on Earth. While other researchers came and went, Hako and Kwil studied various topics in biology and medicine at the local university. They then obtained or ordered forged credentials from their colleagues to work various internships and positions in the medical field.

<details><summary>Twelve's Design spoilers</summary>
Hako was unaware of Kwil's affair with Kaliska. Kwil and Kaliska always had their dates during the day, at times when neither Brand nor Hako would think much of their absences. Hako noticed Kwil's increasing unhappiness over the course of their first year on Earth and his perpetual depression and suppressed terror thereafter though. At first she suspected his urges were the cause. He refused to go home and take a break with the excuse that he didn't want to allow them interfere with his work though. His real reason was that he didn't want to risk encountering Jigo. By the time, Kwil's behavior had disturbed Hako enough to resort to it, her connection to Jigo had faded beyond use.
</details>

In 1999, [[Events/Jigo Kadas Lives\|Jigo became a pruktau]]. Kwil's behavior in response to the event told Hako the true source of his distress; he had done something unforgiveable, something that had prompted the gods to create a baltarik condemned never to rest until he fulfilled a holy commandment. She didn't want to consider what Kwil had done. Instead, she dismissed his obsessive yet hopeless attitude as the same anxiousness they all carried. They still hadn't found a way to fulfill the gods' will. What happened if they never found it? What had this pruktau been sent to do in their stead?

<details><summary>Twelve's Design spoilers</summary>
Nothing came of Kwil's research until 2009. Amid increased pressure from the public for progress, Kwil proposed a daring experiment. All his research supported the viability of the human body accepting baltarik donated tissues, but he needed a test to prove it. He proposed a relatively common and low risk kidney transplant. His team proposed abducting and operating on a transient, someone no one would miss or believe. Kwil proposed the opposite, someone young and resilient, someone with a supportive family, and someone who visited the forest often for ease of abduction. No one suspected he had ulterior motives in choosing Eugene Cusick, his daughter Esarose's closest friend. The unexpected accident that lead to his ultimate choice of Logan Cusick also didn't raise suspicions.
</details>

Hako had always agreed to be the surgeon that would perform the kidney transplant on their chosen doner and receiver candidates. She didn't expect to operate on Kwil, but blood tests revealed he was the best match for Logan among those in the GPO aware of the experiment. Kwil's operation was performed while his colleagues merely kept him numb and stable with kanti. Hako agreed with Kwil, however, considering Logan was already confused and terrified, it would be most humane to also use mind manipulation throughout Logan's procedure to keep him calm and even asleep. As the only one among them who had used mind manipulation, Kwil agreed to do it. His colleagues, already feeling compromised by their role in this increasingly questionable experiment and unable to comfort Logan any other way, agreed never to speak of it.

In the wake of the experiment's near fatal and devastating consequences, Kwil took responsibility for providing most of Logan's care and companionship to spare his colleagues and his wife from the worst of his mistakes. No one was aware that Kwil continued to use mind manipulation on Logan to try to reduce the trauma of the situation. He also began reading Logan's thoughts, already knowing Logan had to be returned home where he would need to be monitored for the rest of his life. At the end of his recovery, Kwil revealed as much to his colleagues and proposed he be [[Events/Kwil Farkos' Sentence\|sentenced to exile]] on Earth as Logan's overseer.

[[Events/Jigo Kadas' Hunt\|Jigo Kadas' Hunt]]

[[Events/Hako Pital in Hiding\|Hako Pital in Hiding]]

Hako arranges a meeting with Draska to propose the idea of sending Jigo to Earth. Draska sees an opportunity to blame Jigo and Kwil for the failed experiment. If she agrees to let Jigo go to Earth too easily, however, she will take the blame for allowing it when the zarkis inevitably exacerbates their problems. Draska refuses Hako's proposal. When Hako threatens to involve the pajas, Darska dares her to. It's the exact outcome Draska hoped Hako would suggest.

Hako proceeds to Ji to arrange another closed court session with the fanvas. Draska requests that Jigo be excluded from the session, so they may speak freely of the Logan Cusick experiment.
