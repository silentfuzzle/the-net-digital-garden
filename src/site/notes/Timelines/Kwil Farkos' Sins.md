Jigo started a relationship with Kwil shortly after the Great Peace Organization was founded. Initially, he was intrigued to find a GPO member at a Need Sanctuary and saw a potential opportunity to obtain insider information. He soon realized that Kwil, like many who frequented the sanctuaries, was deeply troubled. Jigo's interest in him shifted toward helping him.

He learned Kwil was attracted to one of his asexual coworkers, Hako Pital. She also liked him, but he was reluctant to pursue a relationship because he was ashamed of what he was and didn't feel in control of himself. Jigo encouraged him to talk through his feelings and develop healthier habits to treat his sex addiction and negative mindset. Eventually, Kwil felt well enough to admit his feelings to Hako and marry her.

His struggles continued though. Three years into his marriage, Kwil used mind manipulation on Hako to demonstrate his desire for her. After this, Hako insisted that he use the Need Sanctuaries until they were ready to have children, once their duties to the GPO were fulfilled. Jigo was able to convince Kwil to continue his relationship with her, an outcome she wanted as well, but Kwil never forgave himself. It was confirmation that he was unfixable, and his wife's loss of trust in him was well deserved.

In an attempt to revive Kwil's confidence, Jigo included his story in an anonymous collection of anecdotes and arguments supporting allosexual rights a year later. While Jigo had published several such collections in the past, the public found this latest installment particularly compelling not only for Kwil's story but for its arguments including comparisons to human sexuality, spirituality, and morality.

The GPO director Draska Bakein was among the many who didn't share these radical sentiments toward allosexuals. Instead, Draska determined to hunt down the allosexual in the GPO. When she caught Kwil at a Need Sanctuary, she promptly outted him publicly and dismissed him from the GPO. While Kwil was initially unwilling to defend himself, he eventually joined Jigo and Hako in arguing his GPO membership before the pajar. Draska was forced to reinstate his position when both the pajar's judgment and a tight public vote held at her request fell in Kwil's favor.

Hako was the surgeon that removed Kwil's kidney and transplanted it into Logan. She was aware Kwil was using mind manipulation on Logan during his operation to keep him calm and put him to sleep.

Kwil spent more time with Logan than anyone, feeling guilty for it being his project. During his times alone with Logan, he continued to use milder mind manipulation to try to reduce the trauma of the situation. He also began reading Lo
gan's thoughts, already knowing that Logan would need to be observed for the rest of his life. Hako was unaware that Kwil was doing either of these things.

Hako arranges a meeting with Draska to propose the idea of sending Jigo to Earth. Draska sees an opportunity to blame Jigo and Kwil for the failed experiment. If she agrees to let Jigo go to Earth too easily, however, she will take the blame for allowing it when the zarkis inevitably exacerbates their problems. Draska refuses Hako's proposal. When Hako threatens to involve the pajar, Darska dares her to. It's the exact outcome Draska hoped Hako would suggest.

Hako proceeds to Ji to arrange another closed court session with the fanva. Draska requests that Jigo be excluded from the session, so they may speak freely of the Logan Cusick experiment.
