Hako was the surgeon that removed Kwil's kidney and transplanted it into Logan. She was aware Kwil was using mind manipulation on Logan during his operation to keep him calm and put him to sleep.

Kwil spent more time with Logan than anyone, feeling guilty for it being his project. During his times alone with Logan, he continued to use milder mind manipulation to try to reduce the trauma of the situation. He also began reading Logan's thoughts, already knowing that Logan would need to be observed for the rest of his life. Hako was unaware that Kwil was doing either of these things.

Hako arranges a meeting with Draska to propose the idea of sending Jigo to Earth. Draska sees an opportunity to blame Jigo and Kwil for the failed experiment. If she agrees to let Jigo go to Earth too easily, however, she will take the blame for allowing it when the zarkis inevitably exacerbates their problems. Draska refuses Hako's proposal. When Hako threatens to involve the pajar, Darska dares her to. It's the exact outcome Draska hoped Hako would suggest.

Hako proceeds to Ji to arrange another closed court session with the fanva. Draska requests that Jigo be excluded from the session, so they may speak freely of the Logan Cusick experiment.
