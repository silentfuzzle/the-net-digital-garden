[[Events/Jigo Kadas Lives\|Jigo Kadas Lives]]

Hako was the surgeon that removed Kwil's kidney and transplanted it into Logan. She was aware Kwil was using mind manipulation on Logan during his operation to keep him calm and put him to sleep.

Kwil spent more time with Logan than anyone, feeling guilty for it being his project. During his times alone with Logan, he continued to use milder mind manipulation to try to reduce the trauma of the situation. He also began reading Logan's thoughts, already knowing that Logan would need to be observed for the rest of his life. Hako was unaware that Kwil was doing either of these things.

[[Events/Jigo Kadas' Hunt\|Jigo Kadas' Hunt]]

Knowing Jigo Kadas will continue pestering her at the end of his ban from Ji, Hako moves to Marti where her family lives. She makes arrangements with Draska to continue transcribing and publishing Kwil's notes and contributions from there. Draska suggests they request Jigo's permanent exile, but Hako doesn't want him punished for her crimes either.

Two years into Kwil's exile, however, his mental health--paranoia, anxiety, depression, and feelings of being sinful and tainted--has deteriorated to the point where Hako is desperate enough to ask Jigo for help. She follows the latest rumors of the zarkis' whereabouts and uses the nearest kasta center to go to him.

"Two years!?" Jigo exclaims upon seeing her.

"Two years," Hako repeats. "You don't know when to quit. You never have."

For the sake of everyone on the planet he's annoyed, Hako invites him to her home should he ever need to find her again. There, she explains vaguely that something terrible has happened within the GPO. Kwil is the last remaining researcher on Earth. Everyone else has lost faith. Jigo asks why Hako isn't with him. Minimizing how much she tells Jigo, Hako avoids saying that Kwil is exiled. She gives the excuse that Draska wanted him to suffer alone for his mistakes, which is true. 

If Jigo wants to know more, she wants him to convince Kwil to talk. She suspects he's hiding things, things happening now, things that have happened over the past 20 years, and things he won't even admit to her. She knows Kwil used to tell Jigo things he didn't know how to explain or tell her. Jigo understood him better than she ever could. She needs him to help Kwil again, convince him to talk about everything that's driving him insane.

Jigo asks why no one forces him to come home. Hako gives another true excuse: he believes he's the last hope for their species to survive the gods' wrath. Draska won't let him come home either.

Jigo accepts Hako's vague explanations and excuses. He wants to help but points out that he lost his telepathic connection to Kwil almost two decades ago. Kwil hasn't spoken to him since he left for Earth. The GPO would never let Jigo set foot on Earth either.

"I think I know how to get you there," Hako says. If she's become desperate enough to ask Jigo for help, Draska may be desperate enough for a solution to let Jigo try to find one, too. If Draska is still resistant, Hako will involve the pajar. The pajar will listen to reason, and they all know the gods kept Jigo alive for a reason. Why shouldn't they think it is to resolve the GPO's problems?
