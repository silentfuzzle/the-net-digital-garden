Prior to integration into human society, mind manipulation was the safest, most reliable, and most accessible form of contraception for [[Concepts/Need Sanctuaries\|allosexual baltariks]], despite its classification as assault. In this practice, a third party monitors the male baltarik’s state during intercourse. Through telepathic reading and manipulation, the third party controls the timing of orgasm and prompts disengagement beforehand.

Condoms, though viable, were unpopular during this period due to their rarity. During the existence of [[Concepts/The Great Peace Organization\|The Great Peace Organization]], they were the most frequently requested product from Earth-bound GPO researchers but were never adequately supplied. A few baltarik businesses attempted to manufacture reliable condoms, but inconsistent quality led to widespread distrust. It wasn’t until baltariks integrated into human society that condoms surpassed mind manipulation in popularity. This shift was driven not only by their broad availability but also by the decline in education around telepathy and other mental abilities among baltarik youth.

Sterilization surgeries offer temporary effectiveness but are highly impractical. A baltarik’s kantini, or healing energy, eventually regenerates removed reproductive organs, rendering the pain and cost of surgery unjustifiable.

Abortion is technically possible but does not terminate the fetus as it does in humans. Because a baltarik fetus possesses kantini from the moment of conception, it continues developing outside the womb post-abortion. Baltariks born this way exhibit significantly higher rates of emotional and cognitive disorders, including psychopathic tendencies. Thus, abortion is a punishable offense with penalties ranging up to [[Concepts/Exiles\|exile]] to Kadas.

Human-made hormonal birth control products are not viable for baltariks. Kantini violently rejects these products, causing debilitating flu-like symptoms until the product is discontinued or removed from the body.
