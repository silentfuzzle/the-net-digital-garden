Court attendants process requests for hearings, cancellations, and reschedules at the [[Concepts/Pajanil Court\|Pajanil Court]]. At the end of each court day, attendants deliver these requests to the fanva, who schedules them accordingly. The attendant then communicates court dates and times back to requestors the following day or when they return for updates.

At least one Kasta Center on each of the five planets hosts a court attendant. While the fanva ultimately schedules all pajanil court hearings, court attendants provide an alternative method for submitting requests. For baltariks unable to travel to Ji due to a [[Concepts/Exiles\|ban or exile sentence]], for example, court attendants serve as their only means of requesting an audience with the pajani.

Court attendants also exist for convenience. While the fanva is available to take direct requests in quarter-hour intervals between hour-long court sessions each day, wait times often stretch to several [[Concepts/Time Measurements\|hours]]. To mitigate this, court attendants accept requests asynchronously, allowing requestors to submit inquiries without waiting. However, those who approach the fanva directly receive scheduling priority over requests compiled and processed at the end of the day.
