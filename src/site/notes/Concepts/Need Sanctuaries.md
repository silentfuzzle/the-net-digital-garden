In the distant past, most baltariks were heterosexual hetero-romantics. Today, most baltariks are asexual hetero-romantics, a gift they believe the gods bestowed on them in order to be more rational about their choice of partner and environment for raising children. About 2% of the population have differing romantic orientations. Aside from fringe extremists, individuals with these identities enjoy widespread social acceptance. The 6% of baltariks of differing sexual orientations historically receive far more public rejection.

While views are shifting, allosexual (heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual) baltariks are still often shunned as "deviants" rejected by the gods. Many view them with suspicion as malleable and irrational, prone to influence by whoever their sexual partners are. The pajar court doesn't accept such views as evidence of guilt with the argument that anyone can be biased and irrational for any reason, those with a bias against allosexuals being an example.

Need Sanctuaries are secluded locations across the five planets for deviants to fulfill their sexual needs with one another. Attempts are made to keep these locations secret to separate such activities from "polite" society and to discourage outsiders from seeking blackmail or "outting" baltariks as deviants. Due to the number of baltariks who use these locations, however, keeping them a secret is often impossible. Some baltariks, particularly those of younger generations raised to view deviants in a more accepting light, use these locations to healthfully resolve sexual tensions with a small number of partners or a single partner. It is unfortunately not uncommon, however, for baltariks to engage in more risky behaviors such as mind manipulation and orgies for the purpose of unnaturally enhancing and prolonging intercourse as an escape from their rejection from society and self-loathing.

Mind manipulation is a punishable offense in the pajar court for its long-term effects on the brain and its classification as assault. The majority of deviants are sex addicts due to these practices, and most don't seek help from mind doctors due to the stigma of sexual deviance. These unhealthy practices continue to affect younger generations as older baltariks intentionally or unknowingly inflict their abuse on those with less experience.

Deviant activists in the past century in particular have shed light upon how sexual abuse has affected society and its mission to the gods as a whole. The most famous of these activists, Jigo Kadas, a homosexual, has frequented Need Sanctuaries across the Jadu Galaxy as an informal counselor and educator for most of his life. He has argued with hundreds of anonymous anecdotes that allosexuals have as much to offer to the gods' mission as any other baltarik. His most compelling example was GPO member [[Figures/Kwil Farkos\|Kwil Farkos]], who was outted as a bisexual shortly after Jigo published his most recent collection of anecdotes and arguments to the public archives. Such arguments, examples, and human literature recovered by the GPO has inspired the current shift in attitudes toward allosexuals.
