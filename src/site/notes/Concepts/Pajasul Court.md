 The Pajasul Court doesn't accept allosexuality as evidence of guilt. Anyone can be biased and irrational for any reason, those with a bias against allosexuals being an example.
# Court Sessions
The Pajasul Court offers defendants and requestors three types of sessions in which to present their cases:

## Public Sessions
The most common format, public sessions are open to all members of the community. Observers may witness the proceedings, and in cases involving a requestor seeking aid, audience members may volunteer support after the pajas has passed judgment.

## Private Sessions
Reserved for controversial or asylum-related cases, private sessions are restricted to trusted court volunteers. Limiting attendance helps prevent outbursts and distractions. Asylum cases often involve baltariks wanted by the NWO government who seek refuge through the GPO or allied rebel networks. Attendance restrictions protect requestors during judgment, but they should remain aware that the NWO closely monitors the courtâ€™s activities. While NWO law prohibits arrests within the Pajasul Court, the surrounding Zanvie village is under constant surveillance.

## Closed Sessions
Closed sessions are exceptionally rare and may only be attended by individuals personally chosen by the defendant or requestor. Historically, these sessions have been reserved for highly sensitive matters involving the jadun's commandments. They provide a secure environment for presenting concerns to the pajas without risking public unrest or panic.

The decision to hold a private or closed session lies solely with the fanvas. All other cases proceed in public view.
