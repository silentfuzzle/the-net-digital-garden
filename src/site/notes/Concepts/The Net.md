The Net contains all knowledge in the universe from the living and dead, the human and inhuman, the physical and spiritual, the past and present. The equivalent term for The Net in barkes is rakshan, meaning "spirit records." Not all [[Concepts/Spiritual Entities\|Spiritual Entities]] can access all The Net's knowledge.

Incarnated spirits with certain [[Concepts/Psychic Abilities\|Psychic Abilities]] can inconsistently access limited knowledge of spirits bound to their home world(s). Bound spirits may not freely share knowledge crucial to fulfilling the life's purpose or unfinished business of the incarnated spirit or any other incarnated spirits or ghosts the subject may encounter, which usually encompasses most of the Net's knowledge.

Ghosts can consistently access most knowledge of spirits bound to their home world(s), provided the ghost knows they are dead. Sometimes traumatic or sudden deaths cause the spirit to block the memory of their entrance into the afterlife, often experienced as a tunnel. Recognizing their death is usually required for a ghost to also recognize their access to the Net. Knowledge is limited based on the ghost's unfinished business. Bound spirits may not freely share knowledge crucial to fulfilling the life's purpose or unfinished business of the ghost or any other incarnated spirits or ghosts the subject may encounter and be able to communicate with.

Bound spirits have access to all knowledge of their home world(s) and the afterlife. Their knowledge is limited, however, in forests, intersections between worlds. Forests are frequently traveled and prowled by demons, predators to ghosts and bound spirits, which discourages spirits from lingering. Knowledge is limited in other locations where demons are present for this reason as well.

Unbound spirits and demons have access to all the Net's knowledge, which includes the thoughts and knowledge of incarnated spirits. Some suspect that because demons loath sharing their knowledge with other spirits that there is knowledge only demons know. Unbound spirit explorers of the demon home world claim this is impossible.
