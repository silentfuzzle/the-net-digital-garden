Kreid is an Earth-like planet with nearly identical orbital properties. A day lasts 24 Earth hours, with 365 days in a year. Baltarik lifespans are measured in Kreid years. Theologists believe the gods established this standard to emphasize the significance of the baltarik-human relationship. Due to its religious importance, Kreid time serves as the primary unit of measurement across the five planets.

Kadas is a frigid desert planet with twice Earth's gravity. A day lasts about 32 Kreid hours, and a year consists of 280 Kadas days (~373 Kreid days).

Zar and Ji are cloudy, Earth-sized binary planets. A day lasts about 6 Kreid days, while a year spans 65 Ji days (~390 Kreid days). Baltarik inhabitants function in cycles of 24 Kreid hours.

Marti is a tropical, Earth-like planet with 0.8 times Earth's gravity. A day lasts approximately 18 Kreid hours, with a year consisting of 360 Marti days (~270 Kreid days).
