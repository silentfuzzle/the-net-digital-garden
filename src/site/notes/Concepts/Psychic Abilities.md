Most incarnated spirits have some level of sensitivity to spiritual entities and psychic ability with clairsentience being the most common. No sensitivity at all is rare. Sensitivity is a spectrum with most incarnated spirits falling on the low end, some in the middle, and very few at the high end or extremes. 

Psychic ability varies in strength and type from spirit to spirit and even throughout a spirit's physical life. For example, an incarnated spirit may be born with abilities but learn as a child to repress them to conform to a normal state of sensitivity. As another example, near death experiences, specifically remembering entrance into the afterlife, commonly awaken new or reawaken latent abilities.

**Clairsentients** can sense the presence of other incarnated spirits, ghosts, or demons.

**Empaths** sense and experience the emotions of other incarnated spirits, ghosts, or demons.  Depending on the sensitivity of the empath, emotions may or may not need to be expressed through energy to be sensed.

**Aura Readers** see emotion, personality, or illness as a cloud of colors surrounding incarnated spirits, ghosts, or demons.

**Channelers** open themselves to [[Concepts/Spiritual Influence\|possession]], allowing ghosts or demons to communicate or act using their body.

**Mediums** with varying degrees of ability to see or hear other spiritual entities allow for communication between less sensitive incarnated spirits and ghosts or demons.

**Psychometric Psychics** attain partial access to [[Concepts/The Net\|The Net]]'s knowledge through touching objects and reading their histories. They may also be able to read the thoughts, emotions, or memories of incarnated spirits through touch.

**Claircognizants** attain partial access to The Net randomly or situationally. This knowledge may come to them through visions, dreams, or thoughts.
