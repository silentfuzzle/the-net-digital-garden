Corporeal spirits are entities that have or had physical forms. These include incarnated spirits, ghosts, and bound spirits. Unbound spirits include corporeal and incorporeal entities such as demons.

## Incarnated Spirits
Incarnated spirits are bound to the physical realm by a physical body. Having influence over and access to the physical realm and thus greater ability to collect and exert energy, an incarnated spirit's commands and will have power over all other types of spiritual beings. Upon death of the physical body, incarnated spirits may become ghosts, bound spirits, or unbound spirits.

Most incarnated spirits aren't consciously aware of other spiritual entities, but most also have some level of sensitivity to spiritual entities. No sensitivity at all is rare. Sensitivity is a spectrum with most incarnated spirits falling on the low end, some in the middle, and very few at the high end or extremes. Sensitivity, however, also manifests as [[Concepts/Psychic Abilities\|Psychic Abilities]] that vary in strength and type from spirit to spirit.

## Ghosts
A relatively rare type of spirit, ghosts are disembodied spirits bound to the physical realm by unfinished business. Specifically, ghosts are bound to locations with significance to them. They may only leave these locations by [[Concepts/Spiritual Influence\|attaching themselves]] to incarnated spirits. Ghosts have emotions and may express them or otherwise manipulate the physical realm if they have sufficient energy. They are perceived by psychics in the physical form they took in life. Once they have resolved their unfinished business, they may become a bound or unbound spirit.

## Bound Spirits
Bound spirits are spirits free to travel only between their home world(s) and the afterlife. They are bound by their desire to oversee loved ones. Bound spirits have emotions but can't manipulate the physical realm. Once their attachments to loved ones have faded or they otherwise choose, these spirits are unbound.

## Unbound Spirits
Unbound spirits are non-physical beings free to travel between worlds. They have access to all the knowledge of [[Concepts/The Net\|The Net]] and may choose to be reincarnated.

## Demons
Demons are incorporeal spirits capable of converting negative emotions to energy. Not having a physical form, demons usually portray themselves to psychics as something the individual fears but may portray other forms to advance their goal of generating energy. To spirits sensitive to them, they exude a constant, unpleasant aura. Demons have emotions and may express them or otherwise manipulate the physical realm if they have sufficient energy.

They have access to all the knowledge of The Net, but as their goal is often to keep spirits bound and susceptible to their influence, they rarely share their knowledge. Demons may tempt bound spirits to retie themselves to the physical realm as ghosts (for example, by threatening their loved ones). Demons with sufficient energy may also capture and psychologically torture ghosts to stoke negative emotions and generate energy for themselves. Protected by the physical realm, incarnated spirits must invite a demon to similarly influence them. This invitation, however, need not be explicit.
