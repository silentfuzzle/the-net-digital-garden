Baltariks typically serve exile sentences on Kadas, though they may be exiled to any planet. Famously, [[Figures/Kwil Farkos\|Kwil Farkos]] was sentenced to serve part of his permanent exile on Earth. Exile sentences can be either permanent or temporary. A related form of punishment involves banning a baltarik from a planet, which may also be permanent or temporary.

The names and photos of exiled and banned baltariks are recorded and maintained at all kastani centers across the five planets. Baltariks planning interplanetary travel are required to undergo identity scans to ensure compliance with these sentences. Baltariks exiled or banned from Ji are only permitted to break their sentence for the purpose of seeking an audience with the pajani.

Baltarik society does not have a prison system. Permanent exile to Kadas represents the most severe punishment imposed by the pajani and is reserved for baltariks guilty of repeated or extreme acts of violence against other baltariks or other water-based creatures. These acts include torture, rape, imprisonment, and murder. Defying the gods or the pajani may also result in such a sentence.

Lesser exile or banning sentences are determined at the pajani's discretion and are issued for less severe violations of Universally Preferable Behavior, such as crimes of passion, stalking, harassment, theft, assault, and contract breaches. Unique to baltarik society, mind manipulation is considered a punishable offense regardless of the circumstances under which it occurs. For minor offenses, social ostracism and vigilantism by the public are also socially accepted means of discipline.
