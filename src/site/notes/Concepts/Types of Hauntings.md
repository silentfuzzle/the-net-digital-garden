## Environmental
In an environmental haunting, supernatural activity isn't present. Instead, the sensation of being haunted comes from environmental contaminants such as mold, excessive chemicals, high electromagnetic fields, or physical illness. The haunting sensation is only the subconscious mind's attempt to alert the conscious to danger.

## Residual
In a residual haunting, the environment has absorbed a highly emotional or energetic event that replays periodically, manifesting as sounds or even images to incarnated spirits. For example, living inhabitants may hear footsteps, a gunshot, or the sound of something hitting the floor or see a shadowy figure at the same time or place daily or periodically. In these types of hauntings, a ghost or other [[Concepts/Spiritual Entities\|spiritual entity]] is not present to produce this supernatural activity.

## Intelligent
A ghost, poltergeist, or demon is the source of the supernatural phenomena in an intelligent haunting. These entities can respond to questions and have other interactions with the living, distinguishing intelligent hauntings from a residual hauntings. Activity also has more variety and may include objects moving.
